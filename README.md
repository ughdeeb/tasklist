## General info

I have thus far made it to web apps and React on the codecademy track, but I wanted more practice with vanilla javascript to really get the fundamentals down before jumping into React and other frameworks/libraries.
So I decided to work through Brad Traversy's Udemy course called [Modern Javascript from the Beginning](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/) to build some projects using modern vanilla javascript (some of his course content is in ES5, but I have been modifying it to use ES6 syntax whenever possible.)

This particular project is a task list where a user can add, remove, clear and filter through tasks. The tasks are also added to local storage so that if a user closes the browser and comes back later, their tasks will still be there.
