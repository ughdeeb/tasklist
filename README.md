## General info

I have thus far made it to web apps and React on the codecademy track, but I wanted more practice with vanilla javascript to really get the fundamentals down. So I decided to work through Brad Traversy's Udemy course to build some projects using modern vanilla javascript (some of his course content is in ES5, but I have been modifying it to use ES6 syntax whenever possible.)

## Technologies

Technologies used in the creation of this project:

- HTML
- CSS
- JS ES5/ES6
- CLI
- Git and Github (with VS Code)
